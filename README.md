## Motivation:
To investigate the flow of money from drug manufacturers to physicians and how that relates to drug prescriptions. Ultimately, we would like to provide a tool with the capability to identify networks of abuse.

## What this repository contains:
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that process, transform, entity-match, and integrate physician payment data from the Sunshine Act with physician prescription data from Medicare Part D data. Additionally, we utilize an FDA data base to gain more information regarding pharmaceutical companies and their respective drugs.

You will see a large swath of jupyter lab notebooks in this repo. Each of these notebooks provides a very specific and modular step within the integration process. The main and most important notebook is called ["Papermill_Workflow.ipynb"](https://github.com/JonahBreslow/DSE-203-Knowledge-Graph/blob/main/Papermill_Workflow.ipynb). This is the most important notebook to run.

5. Make sure you have all dependencies installed
   - In the future, we will update this repo with the required venv with all dependencies installed
   - Some dependencies you will need:
      - Pandas
      - Numpy
      - Dedupe
      - Papermill
      - Pickle
      - py_stringmatchint
      - (probably more)
6. Run the ["Papermill_Workflow.ipynb"](https://github.com/JonahBreslow/DSE-203-Knowledge-Graph/blob/main/Papermill_Workflow.ipynb).
   - **NOTE:** The first cell may take up to 10 hours. The following cells are far quicker.
7. This generates output csv files into the *"Nodes"* and *"Edges"* folder. 
8. Copy these files into the *"import"* directory in your Neo4j application.
9. Run the *"Cypher_Load"* script in your Neo4j browser
10. Knowledge graph is created!

### Part D Prescriptions
1. Data Methodolgy:
>The Medicare Part D Prescribers by Provider and Drug dataset provides information on prescription drugs prescribed to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part D by physicians and other health care providers. This dataset contains the total number of prescription fills that were dispensed and the total drug cost paid organized by prescribing National Provider Identifier (NPI), drug brand name (if applicable) and drug generic name.
2. Columns:
   - Prescriber Data (Name, NPI, City, State, Specialty)
   - Drug Data (Brand, USAN Generic Name - Short Version)
   - Prescription Data (Number of Medicare Part D Claims, Including Refills, Number of Standardized 30-Day Fills, Including Refills, Number of Dayâ€™s Supply for All Claims, Aggregate Cost Paid for All Claims, Aggregate Cost Paid for All Claims, etc.)

### Questions:
1. How does money affect prescription rates. Do doctors that receive money from pharmaceutical companies presecribe more that/those company's drugs?
2. Is there a similar relationship in regards to the hospital and pharmaceutical companies?
3. Is there a link between how much in total pharmaceutical companies spend in a state and that state's opiod death rate/count?
4. How do dollars given to a doctor per opiod perscription compare to other drugs?
